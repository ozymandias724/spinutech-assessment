simply create a new vhost to view this, i.e., spinutech-test.local
or use something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/sirv-cli
or docker, etc.

tested moving to a new vhost and directory to push to github 
everything to create the scripts and styles is just:
```
npm install
npm run build
(npm run watch is available)
```
